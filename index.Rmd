# Introduction

Wine is an essential component in western food culture. Due to the variety of wine brands, people may easily get lost. Therefore, we would like to provide a review of wines by professional wine tasters and guidance for wine lovers based on variety, location, winery and price. Wine lovers can select and buy wines more easily with information provided on our website.

<br/>

## Data

This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews?select=winemag-data-130k-v2.csvm) contains 13 columns, including country, designation(The vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from), points(The number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1-100), price, province, region_2, region_2, variety(The type of grapes used to make the wine), winery(The winery that made the wine).
<br/>
`country`: The country that the wine is from
<br/>
`description`: A few sentences from a sommelier describing the wine's taste, smell, look, feel, etc.
<br/>
`designation`: The vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from
<br/>
`points`: The number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1-100 (though they say they only post reviews for wines that score larger than 80)
<br/>
`price`: The cost for a bottle of the wine
<br/>
`province`: The province or state that the wine is from
<br/>
`region_1`: The wine growing area in a province or state (ie Napa)
<br/>
`region_2`: Sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank
<br/>
`variety`: The type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Pinot Noir)
<br/>
`winery`: The winery that made the wine
<br/>

## Data Cleaning

The original dataset `winemag-data_first150k.csv` has 150930 observations. <br/>
The numbers of missing values for some important variables are as follows. <br/>
`id`: 0 missing observations. <br/>
`points`: 0 missing observations. <br/>
`price`: 13695 missing observations. <br/>
`country`: 5 missing observations. <br/>
`province`: 5 missing observations. <br/>
`variety`: 0 missing observations. <br/>
`winery`: 0 missing observations. <br/>
Then we create average points and price at the country and province levels respectively for `winemag-data_first150k.csv` data.

# Findings

## Summary Visualization

In this part, we try to analyze our data and visualize them for better understandings. The data is filtered based on different scales, including continent, countries, cities and even areas. Since the amount of data is large, we have separated the data based on regions. We have analyzed and plotted graphs from the scale of globe, continents and countries.

<br/>

We first plotted the average wine Points of Countries Around the Globe and around the Europe. From the graphs, we can find out which country has the highest average wine ranking points and which has the lowest. In general, European countries have higher average wine rankings than Asian countries. Then we analyzed the winery by plotting boxplot. We can see not only the average point of wines a winery made, but also its median, q1, q3 and range. Some wineries have more stable outputs than the others. The ranking histogram indicates that the distribution of rankings of wines is close to normal distribution. Another variable that is important when we are choosing wines is the variety of grapes. The taste of wine, on a great extent, depend on the grapes it chooses. Therefore, we have ranked the most preferred grape types used by different wineries.
