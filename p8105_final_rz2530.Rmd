Cleaning and Tidying Data
```{r, include = FALSE}
wine_df = read_csv("./data/winemag-data_first150k.csv")
wine_df = wine_df %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(country,designation, points,price,province,region_1,region_2,variety,winery) %>%

# Ranking of Wines
Some professional reviewers gave rankings to more than 150,000 types of wines based on their regions, prices, tastes, variety and winery. From the histogram we have plotted, we can see that the distribution of rankings of wines is close to normal distribution and the mean is around `r mean(wine_df$points)`.
```{r}
ggplot(wine_df, aes(x = points,fill=country)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)
```
